Hello, I'm Sahil Khose, a senior CS undergraduate student from MIT Manipal, India. I'm currently working as a research intern at AIRL, IISc Bangalore in the domain of Continual Zero Shot Learning.
<br>
<br>
My research experience and interests are in the field of *Computer Vision, Continual Learning, Zero-Shot Learning, Semi-supervised Learning, NLP and Self-supervised Learning*. Solving deep learning problems using a limited (ideally zero) amount of data is what piques my interest. 
<br>
*Check out my work and the projects in my [resume](https://sahilkhose.github.io/files/Sahil_Khose.pdf)*.

- I have started a research initiative on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/SahilKhose) where I stream a research paper explanations. 
- [Talks](https://sahilkhose.github.io/talks/) include the talks that I have personally presented on my channel.
- [Feed](https://sahilkhose.github.io/feed/) include some of the fascinating ideas that I have read. **[New]**

<br>
I am always open to research collaborations, so if you want to have a discussion about the projects I have worked on or about a potential collaboration, feel free to drop a mail.
