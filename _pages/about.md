Hi! Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D. student at **Georgia Tech**, where Iâ€™m fortunate to be advised by [Judy Hoffman](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~judy/). I completed my bachelorâ€™s at Manipal Institute of Technology, India, in 2022, where I had an incredible learning experience. For my bachelor's thesis, I interned at IISc Bangalore.

My research focuses on advancing areas like Computer Vision, NLP, Semi/Self-supervised Learning, Zero-Shot Learning, Domain Adaptation, and Continual Learning. Iâ€™m passionate about creating deep learning models that require minimal supervision. 

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) â€” if youâ€™re working in this area or just curious, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™d love to chat! ***I am also attending ECCV 2024.***
