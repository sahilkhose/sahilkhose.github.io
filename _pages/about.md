I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at **Georgia Tech**, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Judy Hoffman](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~judy/). My research focuses on developing multimodal vision-language models that integrate spatial, semantic, and temporal reasoning with minimal supervision.

Recent work includes:

1. A 7B open-source VLM for open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation, under review at NeurIPS 2025.

2. SkyScenes, a synthetic aerial dataset for improving real-world segmentation, accepted at ECCV 2024.

3. Generalist Multimodal LLM, where I designed a jointly-trained vision-audio model that outperforms larger generalist systems by reducing cross-modal interference.

I bring prior experience in domain generalization, zero-shot learning, and synthetic-to-real adaptation, focusing on making models robust to diversity, correlation, and semantic shifts in real-world environments. My goal is to build generalizable systems that require minimal labeled data yet remain reliable under distribution shifts.

I also review for top conferences (NeurIPS, CVPR, ECCV), and have published across both vision and language communities.

ðŸŒŸ ***Iâ€™ll be attending CVPR 2025 â€” if youâ€™re around and working in similar areas, Iâ€™d love to connect!***

ðŸ’¼ ***I'm currently looking for research internships for Summer 2026 â€” feel free to reach out if you're hiring!***




<!-- Hi! Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D. student at **Georgia Tech**, where Iâ€™m fortunate to be advised by [Judy Hoffman](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~judy/). I completed my bachelorâ€™s at Manipal Institute of Technology, India, in 2022, where I had an incredible learning experience. For my bachelor's thesis, I interned at IISc Bangalore.

My research focuses on advancing areas like Computer Vision, NLP, Semi/Self-supervised Learning, Zero-Shot Learning, Domain Adaptation, and Continual Learning. Iâ€™m passionate about creating deep learning models that require minimal supervision. 

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) â€” if youâ€™re working in this area or just curious, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™d love to chat!  -->
