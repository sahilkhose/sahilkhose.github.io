Hello, I'm an incoming Fall 2022 student at **Georgia Tech** where I will be pursuing **MSCS** with a **Machine Learning** specialization. 

Currently, I am a senior CS undergrad at MIT Manipal, India. For the past 10 months I have been working as a research assistant at AIRL, IISc Bangalore in the domain of Continual Zero Shot Learning.
<br>

My research interests are in the field of Computer Vision, Continual Learning, Zero-Shot Learning, Semi/Self-supervised Learning and NLP. Solving deep learning problems using a limited (ideally zero) amount of data is what piques my interest. 
<br>

I have a research initiative on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/SahilKhose) for streaming research paper explanations. 
[Talks](https://sahilkhose.github.io/talks/) include the personal explanations on my channel.
[Feed](https://sahilkhose.github.io/feed/) **[New]** include the fascinating ideas that I am reading. 
<br>

I am always open to research collaborations, so if you want to discuss projects that I have worked on or a potential collaboration, feel free to drop a mail. Check out my work in my [CV](https://sahilkhose.github.io/files/Sahil_Khose.pdf).
